    <p><b>Problem:</b> Assuming we've collected some data, the following is not
    exactly easy to read:<br><br>
    0B0010006164647265737320676170A7
    <br><br>
    So how do we make it available to everyone in a nice, neat format? Is there
    a thing everyone of us has? Let me just check some funny memes on my
    <b>phone's browser</b>.

    <p><b>Work done so far:</b> Having concluded that everyone has a phone and
    browser with JavaScript, we now need to write a server serving live data
    nicely formated with the magic of JavaScript. Since graphing is not an easy
    task, we think it might be nice to use some libraries that already to do
    for us (and yes, these can be copied in their entirety and don't require
    internet access).</p>
    <p>Have a look at this comparison: <a target="_blank"
