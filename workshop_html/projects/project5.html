    <h2 align="center">Flight Model</h2>
    <h4 align="center">Welcome to the world where soaring usually means
    accessing memory out of bounds</h4>
    <p>Who doesn't like to fly! --------- Programmers. That was easy.</p>
    <p>In all seriousness judgements about combination of interests, such as
    between programming and flying are in bad taste. Especially considering
    this website is being written by a philosopher-programmer. It was just a
    joke, OK?</p>
    <hr align="center" />
    <p>The idea behind a flight model is the ability to predict the rocket's path
    based on incomplete data. That includes both a break in communication,
    after receiving some data about flight and low refresh speed of the live
    data. Apart from interpolation, a live-update flight model could tell us
    things about current predicted <a target="_blank"
    href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/apogee">apogee</a> and predicted
    landing zone.</p>
    <p>There's a lot of math involved and learning, so most of the things your
    parents warned you about... Or at least ours did. If you're interested in
    making reality on a computer, then you're either a digital God or
    passionate the same things we are.</p>
