    <h2 align="center">Launch Box</h2>
    <h4 align="center">The grandiose redesign of the ignition and oxidizer filling power box</h4>
    <p><b>Problem:</b> The rocket's not going anywhere without ignition! Well,
    hopefully. We also have an issue with our <a target="_blank"
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_rocket">hybrid motor</a> which
    works as it should meaning it needs to be filled with an oxidizer before it
    can fly. And trust me, you don't want to be nearby when it is being filled.
    </p>
    <p>So how do we build a system that lets us fill and ignite a rocket from a
    100m (300 feet) away?</p>
    <hr align="center" />
    <p><b>Work done so far:</b> So far we've built a completely custom system
    of <a target="_blank"
    href="http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/blog/relay-switch-circuit.html">relay
    switch circuits</a> with signals delivered over a 400 feet (130m) wires and
    four levels of safety; common sense, key switch, general safety switch,
    ignition safety switch. The system also allows us to toggle <a
    target="_blank"
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solenoid_valve">solenoid valves</a> to
    control the flow of the oxidizer from ground tanks to the rocket's oxidizer
    tank. Here's the simplified functional graph of the current system:<br />

          Our launch system is hand-soldered and we couldn't be prouder of it,

          Our system is modular. Something breaks, we throw it out and have a
          spare installed within 5 min. Big boards are good, but not when you
          have to repair them.

          We wanted to use the simplest design possible. Someone once said that
          debugging is twice as hard as designing so if you designed it
          cleverly you're not clever enough to debug it.
