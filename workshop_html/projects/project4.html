    <h4 align="center">Ways of making the world more comprehensible by
    transforming it into numbers only computers understand</h4>
    <p><b>Problem:</b> We would only pretend to be engineers if we didn't, from
    time to time obviously, no need to be over-zealous, measure something</p>
    <p>Measuring something turns out to be much more difficult than expected
    since the stupid nature refuses to be measured in the same units in all
    aspects.</p>
    <hr align="center" />
    <p><b>What needs to be done when making measurements:</b> Invariably, any
    measuring functional chain has to consist of:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center"><b>Data -> Sensor -> Conversion -> Storing ->
    Viewing</b></p>
    <p>As the electronics team we don't much care about <b>Data</b> and the
    <b>Sensor</b>. It is the problems of <b>Conversion</b>, <b>Storing</b> and
    <b>Viewing</b> that occupy us the most. Let's look at them closely.
    <hr align="center" />
    <p><b>Conversion:</b> Sensors are usually stupid and by that I mean
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.diffen.com/difference/Analog_vs_Digital">analogue</a>
    and what's worst is it usually is not between 0-3.3V. Why between
    0-3.3V?</p>
    <p>0-3.3V is the simplified range in which our digital devices (such as the
    ATmega328 which is the processor for the most popular Arduinos) can convert
    data between analogue and digital, they use embedded <a target="_blank"
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter">ADCs</a>.
    The problem is to get the signal from whatever it is outputted by the
    stupid sensor and make it vary nicely between 0-3.3V.</p>
    <p>There are more problems than just whether the stupid (we're going to use
    <i>stupid</i> as a synonym to <i>anologue</i>) signal is between 0-3.3V.
    Some signals are <i>the worst</i> and come in a differential form meaning
    that we cannot be sure whether they vary from 0V to something, but we only
    know that they vary as a <i>difference</i> between their two lines. Now, we
    once thought that it would be easy enough to put one of those differential
    lines to ground and be done with it. Unfortunately that's not how it
    works<sup><a name="1_back" /><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. What we need is a
    differential to single ended (anchord at ground at one point, e.g. 0-3.3V)
    signal driver.</p>
    <p>Believe us, after reading through a dozens of websites, this is <a
    target="_blank"
    href="http://www.ecircuitcenter.com/Circuits/adcin_diff_se/adcin_diff_se1.htm">the
    one</a> that finally had the answer. Paired with <a target="_blank"
    href="http://www.linear.com/designtools/software/#LTspice">LTspice</a> and
    we have our circuit! Of course, it actually adapting it is not that
    easy...</p>
    <p>Oh, and by the way we have high precision rail-to-rail operational
    amplifiers, you can thank us later.</p>
    <hr align="center" />
    <p><b>Storing:</b> Now we have to store the data. If you're wondering about
    the step between converting the stupid/analogue signal to a readable range
    of 0-3.3V and getting the data into computer memory then don't worry. It
    literally takes 15 min, quite startling how with all these difficulty that
    part is that easy.</p>
    <p>Fear no more, because our "computer memory" is about 100 bytes long and
    would run out in a second. So what do we do with all the data? We store it!
    That can take the form of storing it on an external flash memory (OK, an SD
    card) or communicating it to a device which has more than a 100 bytes of
    "computer memory".</p>
    <p>Storing on an SD card requires a library for interfacing with the flash
    memory and has thankfully already been done. Take a look at the following
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SD">Arduino
    library</a>.</p>
    <p>Communicating with another device will require the knowledge of
    communication protocols (e.g. <a target=_blank
    href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-communication/all">UART</a>,
    <a target="_blank"
    href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-peripheral-interface-spi">SPI</a>)
    and will mostly be done by means of writing C/C++ code.</p>
    <hr align="center" />
    <p><b>Viewing:</b> And lastly viewing! We encourage you to take a look at
    the <a target="main_content" href="project2.html">Visualization System</a> as this
    will be work at some point connected with that, but for now viewing will
    include making sure the data is human-readable at least to some degree.</p>
    <p>We are personally interested in viewing since we never thought C/C++ and
    artistic opportunity could be placed in the same sentence, but here we are,
    proven wrong by life itself.
    <br><br><br>
    <hr align="center" />
    <p><a name="1" /><a href="#1_back">[1]</a> Usually the sensor is already
    tied to the same power supply (or what's more important <i>could be</i>) so
    one of the differential lines already is at some voltage, say 4.705V (as in
    the example of our <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_cell">load
    cell</a> so tying one of the differential lines to ground would cause a
    short between a 4.705V and ground. Not deadly, but definitely not
    pleasant</p>
