    <h2 align="center">Payload Collaboration</h2>
    <h4 align="center">If you like electronics, don't join this project. Here
    we're putting a lot of effort to get this as far from us as possible. We
    even built a rocket!</h4>
    <p>Payload Collaboration means that the Rocket Project is not collaborating
    on the payload, but that the Bruin Spacecraft Group is building it by
    itself. Wait...</p>
    <p>OK, we got it. Bruin Spacecraft Group is collaborating with the Rocket
    Project and the fruit of collaboration is a rocket with a payload from the
    Bruin Spacecraft Group. OK, so it's a Rocket Collaboration.</p>
    <p>This way or the other this is the place where you're leaving the Rocket
    Project and are deciding to join the Bruin Spacecraft Group to build
    payload with them. We think they're great, otherwise we wouldn't be working
    with them, but we're still sorry that you're leaving us.</p>

    or IMAGINE ONE YOURSELF</p>

    <p><b>Some technical payload information surely no one wants to read:</b>
    The payload will consist of a full sensor package allowing to fully
    determine a 3D position and attitude of a rocket. The used sensors will
    likely include a pair of an accelerometer and a gyroscope, with an aid of a
    digital compass, to determined the attitude of the rocket in 3D rotation
    frame with a reference to a fixed point. The position will have to include
    3D coordinates and so the use of a gps for plane positioning and a pressure
    sensor for altitude sensing appears to be reasonable. The payload must be
    equipped with a local storage device for data logging and means of
    transmitting acquired data to ground. Transmission presents a data rate
    bottleneck and will likely be between 10-100Hz depending on the choice of
    radio and trade-off between transmission robustness. Electrical
    characteristics should involve operation at a maximum of 5V to allow for
    the use of standardized power source (likely a double lithium-ion cell).
