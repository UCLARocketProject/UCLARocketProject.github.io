    <p>Welcome to the main page of the Electronics Workshop by Rocket Project
    at UCLA. Not sure why we're using <i>Rocket Project at UCLA</i> and <i>UCLA
    Rocket Project</i>? Neither are we, that's why we're using both. Just to be
    safe.</p>
    <p>The purpose of the website (as if everything had a purpose) is to
    provide easier access to educational materials provided during the
    workshops, allowing for revision and hopefully covering the material from
    scratch.</p>
