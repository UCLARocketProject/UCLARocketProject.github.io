    <h2 style="text-align: center">Workshop 1 - Foundations of Digital Electronics</h2>
    <p> The first Workshop focused on the Foundations of Digital Electronics,
    covering the topics of resistance (<a target=_blank
    href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider#Resistive_divider>voltage
    divider</a>), <a target=_blank
    href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_power_transfer_theorem>maximum
    power trasfer theorem</a>, capacitance in terms of a short-lasting power
    source, transistors (as a simple electrical switch, allowing the current to
    pass through or not).</p>
    <hr align="center">
    <p><b>Optional homework:</b> If you didn't have enough after the first
    workshop consider the following design problem:</p>
    <p><b>P1.1</b> You have a microcontroller running at 3.3V, but a power supply
    delivering 9V. How would you reduce the voltage down in the best possible
    way. (Rember: A microcontroller can be modeled as a resistive load, but as
    a hugely variable one!)</p>
    <p><b>P1.2</b> Now what if you only have a 1.5V and the same 3.3V microcontroller?</p>
    <p><b>P1.3</b> Build a break-wire circuit which energizes an output line
    when the break-wire is broken.</p>
    <p><b>P1.4</b> Build the same break-wire circuit which connects the output
    line to ground (GND) when break-wire is broken.</p>
    <p><b>P1.5</b> Design the simplest switch circuit (involving a relay and a
    MOSFET at a minimum). Don't forget to define the line state (pull-up,
    pull-down).</p>
    <p><b>P1.6</b> Build an inverter circuit.</p>
    <p><b>P1.7</b> Design a level shifting circuit for digital
    communication.</p>
